# ðŸ§  PyTorch Scavenger Hunt

This mini project walks you through the basics of PyTorch:
- Tensor creation
- Simulated training data
- Neural network definition (MLP)
- Loss, optimizer, and training loop
- Visualization of fake input samples

### ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

### ðŸš€ To Run
Simply open this notebook or `.py` script and run each cell.  
This will simulate a full training pipeline using fake data for practice and learning purposes.

### ðŸ“š What You'll Learn
- How tensors work in PyTorch
- How to build and train a neural network
- Visualizing input data
- Using `CrossEntropyLoss` and `SGD`
